## Alarm Academy - Heuristic Evaluation Report

In this school project, I led a team to conduct a heuristic evaluation of the Alarm Academy online training platform, commissioned by the Alarm Association of Florida. Our goal was to identify usability issues within the legacy platform and recommend improvements to enhance user experience and align with modern standards. This project allowed us to apply heuristic evaluation methods to a real-world application, providing valuable insights into user interface design and usability testing.

## Heuristic Evaluation Methodology

Utilized Jakob Nielsen's heuristic evaluation standards to systematically assess the platform's usability. This approach helped identify key areas where the platform could be improved to meet modern user expectations.
